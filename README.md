# Home automation project #

Yet another home automation project. The main concern of the project is keeping price down, it's a DIY project for makers and hackers:) it is based on a raspberry pi (or another linux compatible board) and arduinos.

### How cheap it will be  ###

The PI, case, SD card and power adapter will be around 70 dollars
Each controller composed of arduino, case, bluetooth device, power adapter, sensors etc will be around 20-30 $ each
The fingerprind module will make an exception and will cost around 70 dollars.
A pair of speakers to play the sounds will be 20$
So if you implement all the features the total will be slightly under **300 $**

### What can it do ###

* unlock a electromagnetic door
* control various types of electric curtains (open / close)
* control remote wall sockets
* monitor temperature, humidity, light level, air quality, human presence 
* display charts with sensors data
* ability to activate a switch, light etc on a time schedule
* email notifications if the alarm is set and someone enters the house
* burgler mode (lights are randomly toggled on and off and voices are played)
* Toggle lights on / off
* toggle all lights off button
* ability to react to sensors output (you can easily write a piece of code to react to sensors data)
